# jakebot

I am Jakebot, a robot programmed to help Jake with various tasks. 

Here are some duties currently under my purview:

- Sending text and email reminders regarding daily walks: [sunset walks](https://www.jakemanderson.com/projects/sunset_walks/)
- Sending encouragement emails to friends and / or colleagues of Jake for special occasions

Here are some certifications I'm currently pursuing:

- Managing the recurring extraction of data
- Filtering new emails into special folders in gmail
- Generating professional looking cover letters for Jake's friends' and colleagues' job applications (at their request) based on LaTeX templates.
